I am a student at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. I know C, C++, Objective C, Swift, Java, JavaScript, Python, x86/ARM ASM and even some ACPI Machine Language. I am a Security Researcher for mobile platforms, firmware, operating systems, browsers, game consoles, GPUâ€™s etc and eventually Cellular, Wireless, 5G, Bluetooth, Cars, etc and previously worked at Apple as an intern in the Firmware Security department as well, who was responsible for developing the T2 Security Chip and SecureBoot. 
On the side, I am also interested in Neuroscience, Physiology, Kinesiology, and Nuclear/Quantum physics

I currently am aiming to do future security research for Apple's platforms such as macOS and iOS, Android, possibly Windows and Linux, web browsers such as Safari and Chrome, targeting proejcts like WebKit, etc, reverse engineering game consoles such as the PlayStation X and the Nintendo Switch, GPU's, and embedded, network and celullar devices/chips in the areas of 5G/LTE/Bluetooth/WiFi and even smart cars. I currently have a background in exploitation, fuzzing, penetration testing, reverse engineering, malware analysis, computer architecture and much more. I am now going to document my knowledge that I am allowed to share for people to readily be able to learn. Email me at ilhan.raja@icloud.com if you have any questions. Here is a link to my [Resume](https://github.com/YungRaj/YungRaj.github.io/raw/master/Resume.pdf).

I am a student at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. I know C, C++, Objective C, Swift, Java, x86/ARM ASM and even some ACPI Machine Language. I have been interested with iOS/macOS and UEFI/BIOS software development for awhile and previously worked at Apple as an intern in the firmware security department as well.

I currently am aiming to do future security research for Apple's platforms, Android, possible Windows and Linux, and network/mobile infrastructures. I currently have a background in exploitation, reverse engineering, malware analysis, computer architecture, etc. The skills I need to get better with are fuzzing, penetration testing, and network/mobile infrastructures, etc and I am now going to document my knowledge that I am allowed to share for people to readily be able to learn. Email me at ilhan.raja@icloud.com if you have any questions. Here is a link to my [Resume](https://github.com/YungRaj/YungRaj.github.io/raw/master/Resume.pdf).
